# AERPAW Controller (Server) Configuration

# Target waypoints in ENU coordinates (meters: east, north, up)
# Grouped by client: first N entries = Client 1, next N = Client 2, etc.
# Each client must have the same number of waypoints.
#
# Flight pattern:
#   UAV 1 (45m alt): straight line along x-axis, 4m intervals
#   UAV 2 (30m alt): triangular path, diverges then converges
#
#   WP1: x=0   (close,  ~10m apart)
#   WP2: x=4   (medium, ~20m apart)
#   WP3: x=8   (far,    ~25m apart)
#   WP4: x=12  (medium, ~20m apart)
#   WP5: x=16  (close,  ~10m apart)
#
#   Max distance from origin: ~22m (all waypoints within geofence)
#
targets:
  # UAV 1: straight line along x-axis at y=5, alt=45m
