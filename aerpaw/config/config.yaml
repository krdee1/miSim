# AERPAW UAV Guidance System Configuration
# This file contains all settings for both simulation and testbed environments

# ENU coordinate system origin (AERPAW Lake Wheeler Road Field)
origin:
  lat: 35.727436
  lon: -78.696471
  alt: 0.0  # Alt=0 means ENU z directly becomes target altitude above home

# Target positions in ENU coordinates (meters)
# Each target is assigned to a client in order: client 1 gets targets[0], etc.
targets:
  - [10.5, 20.3, 45.0]   # Client 1: east, north, up
  - [25.0, 30.0, 30.0]   # Client 2: east, north, up
